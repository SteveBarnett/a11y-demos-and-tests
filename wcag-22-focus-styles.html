    <main id="content">
      <h2>What to check</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Focus styles take up an area at least equivalent to at a 1px border
          around the element.
        </li>

        <li>
          The change of contrast of the indicator between focused and unfocused
          states has a ratio of 3:1.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the focus indicator does not have 3:1 contrast ratio with its
          adjacent colors, check that it is at least 2px thick.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Some examples</h2>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>outline: solid 1px blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-outline">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border. (A default outline is around
          the element, so it's bigger than a 1px border).
        </li>
        <li>✔️ Contrast of blue on white: 8.59.</li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-box-shadow">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border. (A defaolt outline is around
          the element, so it's bigger than a 1px border).
        </li>
        <li>✔️ Contrast of blue on white: 8.59.</li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>box-shadow: 1px 1px 0 1px blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-box-shadow-offset">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>❌ Focus area is less than a 1px border.</li>
        <li>✔️ Contrast of blue on white: 8.59.</li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>box-shadow: 2px 2px 0 1px blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-box-shadow-offset-more">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border (because the offset is 2px in
          x and y directions).
        </li>
        <li>✔️ Contrast of blue on white: 8.59.</li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>box-shadow: 0 0 2px 1px blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-box-shadow-glow">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border: the blur is 2px, but it
          actually spreads a bit more than that.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✔️ The darkest part of the shadow is 1px wide and is #438af7. That's
          3.37 with white, so it just makes the contrast requirements.
        </li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        Focus style: <code>box-shadow: 0 0 2px 1px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);</code>
      </h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-box-shadow-soft-glow">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border: the blur is 2px, but it
          actually spreads a bit more than that.
        </li>
        <li>
          ❌ The darkest part of the shadow is 1px wide and is rgba(255, 0, 0,
          0.5), which is #aabff6. That's only 1.82 with white, so it doesn't
          make the contrast requirements.
        </li>
        <li>✔️ Focus indicator has contrast of more than 3:1.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Focus style: <code>background-color: blue;</code></h3>

      <button type="button" class="focus-background">Button</button>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus area is more than a 1px border: it's the whole element.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✔️ The change from lightgrey background to blue background has a
          contrast of 5.73. (But will fail text on backgroud color contrast! So
          the text should change to white on focus to fix this)
        </li>
        <li>
          ✔️ Focus indicator is blue, so it has contrast of 8.59 with the
          background.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Focus style: <code>text-decoration: none</code> (remove underline) and
        <code>outline: none</code>
      </h3>

      <a href="#content" class="underline">Link</a>

      <ol>
        <li>
          ❌ Focus area is less than a 1px border: it's only as big as 1px x one
          side of the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          ✔️ The contrast changes from blue to white (the background colour), so
          it's 8.59.
        </li>
        <li>
          ❌ Focus indicator does not have a contrast of more than 3:1, and it
          not more than 2px thick.
        </li>
      </ol>
